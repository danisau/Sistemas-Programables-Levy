Objective of the program: Simulate the interaction of the functionality of a traffic light that regulates the traffic of vehicles where,
the Green light indicates when the vehicles must cross, the Yellow light indicates that the vehicles must decrease the speeD to stop and 
the Red light indicates to the vehicles that must be in total height. The sequencing of the lights will be based on the system of the 
United Kingdom, where first goes from Green to Yellow and then to Red, after a certain time the Red light goes to the Yellow and finally 
to Green where the vehicles can circulate again. 
On the other hand, also the program simulates a pedestrian traffic light, where the Green light indicates the pedestrian who can cross 
the street and Red light that waits for the vehicles to stop. When the red light of the traffic lights of the vehicles is Green, the light
Red of the pedestrians traffic light must be in Red, and when the traffic light of the vehicles is Red, the Green light the pedestrian 
traffic light must be on.
